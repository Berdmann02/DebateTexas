                  The Janet Melton and Sandra Green Debate Institute was created to honor to 
                  remarkable women that served the speech and debate community. They helped guide 
                  countless individuals into the field of education, specifically speech and debate. 
                  They had recruited and convinced numerous students each year to just give it a shot. 
                  Named after two women that were pivotal to the speech and debate community, specifically 
                  in Central Texas, the MGSDI aims to allow individuals the opportunity to learn and hone 
                  the craft of communication.

                <h6 class="text-tertiary main-camp-2 mt-3">
                  Sandra Greene was a big proponent of "get 'em on the bus". She figured if you just got
                   people to that first tournament, whether it was a UIL Ready Writer, or a brand new coach, 
                   or a novice CX debater, they would be better off at the end of that day as humans than they
                    were at the start. And while she retired, she never stopped teaching. Long after her coaching 
                    days she was a fixture in tabrooms throughout the state.

                  Janet Melton was an incredible proponent of speech and debate. In particular, she was a driving 
                  force behind rural debate and small school debate. Mrs. Melton brought the best out of her students
                   competitively, but more importantly, attitudinally. For Janet, wins in speech and debate weren’t
                    the infrastructure for the activity. Instead, Janet believed that speech and debate is a venue 
                    where students could find themselves and grow. Despite leaving this world too soon, Janet’s 
                    legacy permeates the community.
